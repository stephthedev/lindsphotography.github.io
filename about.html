				Welcome to my website! My name is Lindsay Garcia, a Southern California photographer who also can consider herself a husky mama. Here's a little bit myself and my passion.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have been photographing for about 8 years now and every day is a new challege but also an accomplishment. Taking care of my clients is my number one priority because I know what type of photos they are looking for. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I do documentary, landscape, portraiture, etc. Anything you could think of, I can make it happen. And although photography is everything to me, I do the occassional every day life like video games, reading, listening to music and so on.
			</p>

			<p>
				My life is full of wonder and art. Working with families, kids, animals, I can do it all. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Take a look at my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and <a href="#contact-form">get in touch</a> so we can get started on creating something beautiful!
